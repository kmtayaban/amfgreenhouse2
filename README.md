# Background
This project examined the effect of fertilization and tillage practices, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) identity on AMF inoculant establishment, resident AMF community in the soil, and plant host response. We used pot experiments in the greenhouse to test whether four fertilization and tillage combination treatments, three AMF inoculant isolates, and other factors such as harvest times, colonization region, and soil conditions affect the ability of the inoculants to colonize roots and establish in soil, shift resident AMF community in the soil, and improve plant host responses. We sampled soils and roots to quantify their establishment success using digital droplet PCR, extracted genomic soil DNA to assess shifts in resident AMF community using next-generation 18s rRNA sequencing, and to determine plant host responses by measuring plant growth responses.
